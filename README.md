# TODOs-Manager
This repository holds the source code I've built for my own TODOs manager web application using React.
I'm working on this project while I learn about the framework.

The web application **has been deployed** in the following url: https://fai-aher.github.io/TODOs-Manager/

## Update: 13-04-2024
